## Fashion MNIST Image Classification

### Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different categories of clothing items. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size.

The primary goal is to train a CNN model to accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

### Dataset
- **Fashion MNIST Dataset:** 70,000 grayscale images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
- **Categories:** T-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.

### Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Data visualization
- CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of training metrics

### Libraries Used
- **TensorFlow & Keras:** For building and training the CNN model
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization

### Project Structure
1. **Importing Libraries:** Essential libraries for the project
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Normalizing image pixel values to a range of 0 to 1
3. **Data Visualization:** Displaying sample images with labels
4. **Building the CNN Model:** Constructing the model with convolutional and pooling layers
5. **Model Training:** Training the CNN on the Fashion MNIST dataset
6. **Evaluation:** Testing the model's performance on unseen data
7. **Visualization:** Plotting accuracy and loss graphs
